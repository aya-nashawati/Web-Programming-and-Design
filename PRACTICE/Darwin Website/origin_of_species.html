                    <h2>Chapter 15: Recapitulation and Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>In the final chapter Darwin notes the book has been "one long argument," and his goal is to summarize the arguments in an attempt to convince the reader of the full strength of his case. He also readdresses some of the arguments that have been posited against the theory of natural selection, noting that in all cases, "They are by no means sufficient to overthrow" the theory of natural selection.</p>
                        <p>It is also in this chapter Darwin defines explicitly for the first time the difference between creatures "produced by special acts of creation" and varieties "produced by secondary laws." This puts his earlier argument—there is no distinction between species and varieties—into perspective. Darwin claims the current method of defining what constitutes a "species" versus a "variety" is flawed. He goes on to say basing the distinction on created versus non-created organisms is inherently ineffectual if natural selection is considered the main form of variation seen in the natural world.</p>
                        <p>Darwin ends the chapter by reiterating he does not find natural selection to be the only means by which variations in organisms occur. However, he claims it is the main form by which variation occurs. He notes the main reason people may fail to consider the theory of natural selection is because they are "slow in admitting great changes" when the process is not immediately apparent. However, he argues the natural world becomes inherently much more interesting when change is believed to occur due to natural selection, as opposed to acts of creation. In Darwin's words, "There is grandeur in this view of life."</p>
