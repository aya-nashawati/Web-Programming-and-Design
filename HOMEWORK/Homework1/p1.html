            This is me. I am a Computer Science student at the American University of Beirut and I have just start learning
            about Web Design and programming. 
            <br>
            I <em>look</em> happy because this is my first assignment on using HTML.

            I have been told that I am also going to learn about other exciting technologies like:
            <ul>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>AJAX</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
            </ul>
            I am at one of the best universities in the region. I would like to invite you to have a look at our department's webpage found at <a href="https://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/cs/Pages/default.aspx">CMPS dept.</a>
